            <h1>Lalibela</h1>
        <div class="paragarph1">
          <p> 
            The small town of <b> Lalibela </b> , high in the mountains of northern Ethiopia, is one of the most important pilgrimage places of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.
            It boasts no fewer than 11 of the exceptional rock-hewn churches that are the most remarkable monuments to have survived from medieval Ethiopia.
            There are numerous rock-hewn churches in Ethiopia, notably in the northern highlands, and the tradition has continued into recent times.
            The Lalibela examples are exceptional,both because of the sophistication of their design and craftsmanship, and because the proximity 
            of several examples permits the establishment of a sequence. </br>They are carved inside and out from soft volcanic rock and their architecture 
            is extremely diverse: some stand as isolated blocks in deep pits, while others have been cut into the face of a cliff. The huge task represented 
            by the cutting of these churches and their associated trenches, passages, and tunnels during the reign of a single king is explained by the church
            as the work of angels who worked so fast that all the churches are said to have been completed within King Lalibela quarter-century rule.
            New research offers a different explanation and it can now be argued that the oldest of the rock-hewn features at Lalibela may date to the seventh
            or eighth centuries about 500 years earlier than the traditional dating. </br>These first monuments were not originally churches, although they were
            subsequently extended in a different architectural style and converted to ecclesiastical use. Later, perhaps around the 10th or 11th century,
            the finest and most sophisticated churches were added, carved as three- or five-aisle basilicas and retaining many architectural features that may
            be traced back to ancient Aksum, which had flourished some 400-800 years. The last phase of Lalibela development that may be dated to 
            the reign of the king whose name the place now bears. </br>The church complex was extended and elaborated during King Lalibela quarter-century rule.
            Several of the features attributed to this last phase bear names such as the Tomb of Adam or the Church of Golgotha, which  mirror those of places visited
            by pilgrims to Jerusalem and its environs. This naming has extended to natural features: the seasonal river that flows though the site is known as Yordanos (Jordan)  
            and a nearby hill is called Debra Zeit (Mount of Olives). It seems that it was King Lalibela who gave the place its present complexity and form in an effort to
            make it a substitute for Jerusalem as a place of pilgrimage. It may be significant that, early in King Lalibela reign, the Muslim Salah-ad-Din (Saladin) had captured
            Jerusalem, and for this reason Ethiopians may have felt disinclined to make the traditional pilgrimage to the Palestinian Holy Land. Today, a cloth-draped feature in 
            the Church of Golgotha is pointed out as the Tomb of King Lalibela.</br> It is not known whether this attribution is original or whether pilgrimage to this tomb was a later
            development. Be that as it may, Lalibela remains to this day a major Ethiopian pilgrimage centre, and an increasingly popular tourist destination. Their building is 
            attributed of king Lalibela who set out to constructed in the 12th centurey a <b>New Jerusalem</b>, after Musilm conquests halted Christtian pilgrimages to the holy Land.
            The one church at Lalibela that does not form part of an interconnecting complex is in many ways the most remarkable. This church known as Beta Giyorgis (The House of
            [Saint] George) and may belong to the most recent of the phases now recognised. It rises from the bottom of a roughly rectangular pit approximately 11 metres deep, and is 
            approached by an entrance trench some 30 metres long.</br> It is cruciform in plan and stands on a high stepped plinth. The lower windows, carved according to the Aksumite pattern,
            are all false and do not penetrate into the church interior. The higher windows, one central to each face, are in a distinctive style. However, when viewed from the inside,
            they do not appear central because no account was taken for the thickness of the wall,thus demonstrating that the design was based primarily on external appearances.
            <div class="link1"><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org"> Wikipedia</a></div> <i>Lalibela flourished after the decline of the Aksum Empire.There are two main groups of churches to the north of the river Jordan:</i>

               <ol>
                <li>Biete Medhanialem(House of the Saviour of the World)</li>

              The simplicity of stone, silence, and ascetcism in lalibela are symbols 
              of coptic faith. Priests like statues with silver cross in hand stand 
              guard before sacred inner chambers.Hermits in ragged cloth hold tattered
              player books and speak to no one but God.At night , they retreat into the
              rock catacombs that have served as tombos for saints and priests.
              These shallow caves in the trenches surrounding the most scared churches 
              once bore relicbones. Now they house only an occasional tuft of straw, which 
              sotnes the rock surface of a pious man's bed. A hermit or monk sleep here to 
              bring himself closer to God.  <div class="link2"><a href="http://www.cnewa.org">cnewa</a></div>

              The interiors of the churches are illuminated by shadowy sunbeams through narrow slits, 
              crosses, and semicircles cur into the rock near the legend of lalibela written on the church
              wall. Pictures of saints carefully etched over 800year ago color these cool hall.Painted on
              the wallpf Beit Maryam(House of Mary)is a picture of two womwn sitting side by side, babies on their 
              laps and one of the Queen of shaba in her royal apparel and handmaid. The legend of Lalibela indeed 
              the legendar history of Ethiopiabegins with the queen of Shaba and her visit to king solomon.
              He fathered a son to the queen and and another to her handmaid. <a href="http://www.yealemtube.com">Yealemtube</a>
